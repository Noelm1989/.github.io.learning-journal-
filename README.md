## Welcome to Noel's Learning Journal

This journal is to chronicle my progress in Code 102 through @codefellows. First topic of discussion is *growth mindset*.

### Growth Mindset

Growth mindset is the idea that through persistance you can always improve yourself and your life. I think of growth mindset on the macro level as an ideology and on the micro level as a set of practices.

###### Ideology
The concept of growth mindset permeates the ideologies and mythologies that we live by. The American Dream is that through hard work we can do a little bit better than our parents. The mantra of our education system is that through education we can help young people reach their full potential. Our Founding Father's embraced a growth mindset when they set out to improve the lives of the American settlers through a new form of government - democracy. 

###### Practices
Believing in one or more ideologies or mythologies which at their core are about a growth mindset may give meaning to life but does not offer much guidance with regards to embracing a growth mindset in daily life. In his [blog](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset) Steve Haffenden talks about incorporating a growth mindset into everyday life - in particular he focuses on challenges at work. A lot of it is about staying positive and avoiding procrastination. He had three suggestions that I am going to focus on:

-Challenges: When you get stuck on a problem stay calm and take a step back. When you return to the problem try think about it in new ways.

-Success of Others: Don't get jealous of the success of others. Instead use their success as an inspiration. Also try to figure out how their skills are complementary to your own. 

-Procratination: There are always tempting distractions, especially when you are stuck on a problem. Recognize these temptations and resist.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Noelm1989/.github.io.learning-journal-/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
